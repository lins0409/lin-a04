/*
*Knowing how often a word appears in a sentence or block of text is helpful for creating word clouds and other types of word analysis. And itâ€™s more useful when running it against lots of text.
*
*Create a program that reads in a file named `exercise46_input.txt` and counts the frequency of words in the file. Then construct a histogram displaying the words and the frequency, and display the histogram to the screen.
